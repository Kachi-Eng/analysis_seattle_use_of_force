## Project Name
Assessing Crisis Intervention Training (CIT)


## Project Description
This project was to quantify the impact or lack of impact of CIT on crises that resulted in Level 2 or Level 3 uses of force (UOF) by police officers in the Seattle area.

## Results
The West Precinct has the lowest amount of CIT-Certified officers but also the highest amount of use of force incidents. Officers within the 23-34 age group were the least trained and only reduced their use of force incidents by 2% overall vs 35% across all the age groups. We recommend that more efforts should be made to train Officers in the West Precinct and within the 23-34 age group.

In 2020, the summer protests coincided with the suspension of CIT and resulted in a significant increase in crisis incidents involving Level 2 and above UOF.

There was an increase in Use of force incidents between May and August, we recommend providing the training just before the beginning of summer months (March/April) to minimize the UOF incidents (refer to Appendix).

When comparing SPD data collection with other police departments (NOPD), we recommend that SPD collect additional UOF data such as reason for use of force, light condition, subject influencing factors, and subject height/build.

Based on feature input the model outcome has an 82% accuracy at predicting if a Use of Force will occur. This information can help develop strategies for reducing the Use of Force incidents.
